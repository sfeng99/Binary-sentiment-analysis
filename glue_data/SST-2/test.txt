Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani -- particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!
what a disappointment
The movie is terribly boring in places.  
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  
Great Product.
I highly recommend this device to everyone!
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.
Nice design and quality.
Good show, Samsung.
Don't buy this product.
Poor sound quality.
I bought two of them and neither will charge.
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  
definitely will come back here again.
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  
Will go back next trip out.
What a mistake.
The problem was the script.  
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).
I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
Perfect for the PS3.
But the service was beyond bad.
Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
Crust is not good.
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.
Don't buy this product - It fails!.
New Battery works great in phone.
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  
The staff are great, the ambiance is great.
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.
It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  
A standout scene.  
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  
I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).
That was funny.  
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  
Fantastic earphones.
I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.
I won't be back.
It was quite comfortable in the ear.
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.
VERY comfortable.
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.
The iGo chargers and tips are really great.
I keep watching it over and over.  
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  
Beautiful styling though.
Would not reccommend.
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.
Go watch it!  
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  
I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  
They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.
the cast was great.  
It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  
Everything was gross.
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  
It also had a new problem.
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.
I came out of it feeling angry.  
I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.
Always a pleasure dealing with him.
Very bad Experience!
God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.
Overall, I like this place a lot.
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.
Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  
He was terrible!
Great charger.
The sound quality is excellent as well.
This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.
This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  
But I don't like it.
No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.
Freezes frequently4.
Looks great and is strong."
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.
AN HOUR... seriously?
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.
Don't buy this product.
The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  
VERY funny!  
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  
John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.
- Really, really good rice, all the time.
Owner's are really great people.!
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.
I LOVED it!
Awesome selection of beer.
I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  
Not as good as I had hoped.
Food quality has been horrible.
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.  
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  
None of it works, just don't buy it.
The film is way too long.  
Once your food arrives it's meh.
Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.
That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.
And then tragedy struck.
It's just painful!  
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  
You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  
Ray Charles is legendary.  
I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  
This phone works great.
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  
Not even good for camp value!  
Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
Either way, it sucks.  
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  
This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  
Poor Talk Time Performance.
One of the worst shows of all time.  
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.
Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  
Waitress was a little slow in service.
I am glad I purchased it.
However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  
Good Service-check!
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!
And it was way to expensive.
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.
Food was really boring.
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  
Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!
How awesome is that.
Never again will I be dining at this place!
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  
The acting was bad.  
The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.
Awful.  
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its "real traditional Hunan style".
Highly recommended A+  
I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.
Everything was fresh and delicious!
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  
The design is very good.4.
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.
The kids are annoying.  
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.
Great bluetooth!.
- the food is rich so order accordingly.
No plot whatsoever!  
There was hardly any meat.
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.
Really awful.  
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.
The patio seating was very comfortable.
Awful service.
Then, there's the plot holes.  
The service was extremely slow.
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.
The worst one of the series.  
Good value, great food, great service.
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.
My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.
Does not fit.
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.
will definitely be back!
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The result is a film that just don't look right.  
The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.
Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!
Reasonably priced also!
All of the main players are mesmerising.  
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.
The story line is just awful!  
This was like the final blow!
I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  
Excellent product.
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.
Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.
I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.
It deserves strong love.  
I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
Both great!
Great choice!
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
Avoid, avoid, avoid!  
The pizza selections are good.
This is a good joint.
Great for using with your home stereo.
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  
It was a great phone.
I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.
That company is a joke.
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  
Provides good protection and looks classy, too.
However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  
The acting is beyond abysmal.  
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.
This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.
The delivery was on time.
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.
Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.
The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  
Does Not Work.
Disappointed with battery.
Nice docking station for home or work.
During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.
I never come again.
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  
This fixes all the problems.
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
The block was amazing.
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  
I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.
This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!
We are so glad we found this place.
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.
Battery is holding up well.
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  
They do not care about the consumer one bit.
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!
Please dont waste your money.
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!
When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!
It felt too light and "tinny.".
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.
The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.
Very much disappointed with this company.
I liked it.  
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  
She carries the movie well.  
A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.
Easy to use.
What a great double cheeseburger!
We won't be returning.
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  
Not a good bargain.
SWEETEST PHONE!!!
I am also very happy with the price.
This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  
The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  
To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!
The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it's unpredictability.  
I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.
I am sorry I made this purchase.
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  
Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  
Thank you for such great service.
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.
I Was Hoping for More.
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  
Even worse than Ticker!  
Its reception is very very poor.
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  
See it.  
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
I loved it, it was really scary.  
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  
I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  
This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  
Nice case, feels good in your hands.
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  
If you want a real scare rent this one!  
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  
Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  
The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.
Everything is appalling.  
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.
Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  
This film has no redeeming features.  
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
The manager was the worst.
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.
Needless to say, I wasted my money.
Do not waste your time.  
This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  
Fantastic food!
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!
In short, don't bother with this movie.  
Stay Away From the Q!.
The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  
Worst Customer Service Ever.
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
This is just a great movie.  
The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.
She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  
Never got it!!!!!
The food wasn't good.
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.
"You'll love it!  
Went for lunch - service was slow.
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.
Worst Thai ever.
Go To Place for Gyros.
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.
The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  
I wasted my little money with this earpiece.
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  
OMG, the food was delicioso!
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.
Doesn't do the job.
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.
It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  
I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.
I could not recommend these more.
Those burgers were amazing.
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  
Thank you for wasting my money.
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!
Great pork sandwich.
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
Sauce was tasteless.
Avoid at all costs.  
Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.
Food arrived quickly!
It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.
This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  
Seriously killer hot chai latte.
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.
Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  
It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  
W810i is just SUPERB.
Food was average at best.
I am more than happy with this product.
This PDA rocks.
However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  
Pretty awesome place.
I promise they won't disappoint.
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.
Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
Overall, a delight!  
Does everything it should and more.
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  
I love this device.
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.
Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.
The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  
The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.
Highly entertaining at all angles.  
This is a great deal.
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
The desserts were a bit strange.
A Disappointment.
It Was So Cool.  
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.
Extremely Tasty!
however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!
What a waste.
We definately enjoyed ourselves.
One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  
The noise shield is incrediable.
Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  
My sister has one also and she loves it.
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
And it was boring.  
It is very comfortable on the ear.
(It works!)
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.
This is a stunning movie.  
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!
As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.
The food was terrible.
I'd like to return it.
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.
Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.
The Macarons here are insanely good.
Was not happy.
Battery is terrible.
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
An Italian reviewer called this "a small, great film," and that's right.  
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
Its not user friendly.
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.
It's pretty easy.
Nice ambiance.
The acting sucked.  
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  
This device is great in several situations:1.)
The only downside is the service.
AMAZON SUCKS.
The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  
Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.
Poor Reliability.
Overall, I like there food and the service.
Yes, it's that bad.  
Unfortunately, it was not good.
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
What a mistake that was!
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.
Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  
As for the service, I thought it was good.
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  
Great product, fast shipping!.
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.
You can't beat that.
It's just lame.  
Pretty good beer selection too.
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.
Left very frustrated.
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!
The waitresses are very friendly.
A greasy, unhealthy meal.
The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  
A great touch.
It's AGGRAVATING!
Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.
I've had better atmosphere.
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.
2 Thumbs Up!!
Returned 8 hours later.
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.
